# PunchOutDS V0.4.1

This is a Punch-Out!! - Arcade emulator for the Nintendo DS.
It has bugs in the tile/palette rendering.
You should still be able to enjoy the games though. =)

## How to use

1. Create a folder named "acds" in either the root of your flash card or in
 the data folder. This is where settings and save files end up.
2. Now put punchout.zip/punchouta.zip/punchoutj.zip/punchita.zip/
 spnchout.zip/spnchouta.zip/spnchoutj.zip/armwrest.zip/ into a folder where
 you have (arcade) roms.
3. Depending on your flashcart you might have to DLDI patch the emulator.

When the emulator starts, you can either press L+R or tap on the screen to open
 up the menu (the emulator tries to load "Punch-Out!! (Rev B)" automagically on
 startup). Now you can use the cross or touchscreen to navigate the menus, A or
 double tap to select an option, B or the top of the screen to go back a step.

To select between the tabs use R & L or the touchscreen.
